Multiscale Implicit Filtering


Copyright (C) 2008 Julian Schnidder

About mimfil
============
Mimfil is a set of routines that solve (box-constrained)
optimization problems where the objective function is
noisy and may fail for some function evaluations.
The original implicit filtering algorithm is enhanced by
a multigrid approach.

Installation
============
Make sure, that all m-files are in the file-path of Octave or Matlab.
